        <p><u><b>Who is Nate Feuerstein?</b></u></b></p>
            Nathan John Feuerstein, professionally known as NF, was born in 1991 and
      grew up in Gladwin, Michigan. His childhood was not always easy. Growing
      up, he and his two sisters were raised by his mother, who was addicted to
      opioids, until his father took him away. Unfortunately, his mother passed
      away from an overdose in 2009. This sparked NF to write the heartfelt song
      "How Could You Leave Us" as a dedication to her. Using rap music as an
      escape as a child, he would record using a karaoke machine. Growing up,
      his grandfather was a pastor at the local church, sparking an early
      interest in Christian Shortly after graduating high school, NF began his
      career at the Fine Arts Festival organized by Connection Church in Canton,
      Michigan. Afterward, NF independently released his debut album, Moments.<p>
      Before seeing success as an artist, he paid the bills by working as an
      electrician. Rapper NF has amassed a huge fan base since his 2010 debut.
      With over 3.2 million followers on Instagram, more eyes are on him than
      ever. With six albums to his discography, he holds two RIAA-certified
      platinum albums. On October 6, 2017, NF released his third studio album,
      Perception. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, making it his
      first chart-topping album and the second artist in 2017 to release a No. 1
      album without having charted on the Hot 100. The next week, "Let You Down"
      became his first single to chart on the Hot 100, debuting at 87. It became
      a sleeper hit, taking 17 weeks to reach its peak at No. 12. After the
      success of Perception, he announced he would begin touring mid-2018 with
      rappers Logic and Kyle. It was certified platinum—selling over 1,000,000
      units—by the RIAA on January 11, 2019. His song "Destiny" is included in
      the video game MLB The Show 18. In 2018, NF released the non-album single
      "No Name" on January 19. Later, he would release the song "Why", the first
      single preceding his fourth studio album. On May 30, 2019, he released the
      title track of the album "The Search". He would later release two more
      singles, "When I Grow Up" on June 27, and "Time" on July 12. 
      <p>
      The search was released on July 26. On December 3, 2019, Feuerstein released the
      single "Paid My Dues", as well as a music video for the song. In October
      2020, NF returned with the non-album single "Chasing_(Demo)", after
      sharing a snippet of it online. The song features 15-year-old Australian
      fan Mikayla Sippel, who uploaded a cover of it, which inspired NF to
      officially release the song after being "blown away" by her version. 
      <p>
      on February 18, 2021, NF released the single "Clouds", alongside a music
      video, and announced his mixtape of the same name, which was scheduled for
      a March 26, 2021, release. The mixtape included "Paid My Dues", as well as
      guest appearances from rappers Hopsin (Lost/LOST) and Tech N9ne
      (Trust/TRUST), followed by a third single, "Lost" featuring Hopsin,
      released on March 11, 2021.[33] On March 26, 2021, Clouds (The Mixtape)
      was released.
